## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

This section outlines the key entities in the Airbnb Clone project and their relationships, forming the backbone of the database structure.

- **Users**:
  - **Fields**: `user_id` (primary key), `email`, `password` (hashed), `name`, `phone_number`.
  - **Relationships**: A user can own multiple properties (one-to-many) and create multiple bookings (one-to-many).

- **Properties**:
  - **Fields**: `property_id` (primary key), `host_id` (foreign key to Users), `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`, `location`.
  - **Relationships**: Belongs to one user (host) and can have multiple bookings (one-to-many) and reviews (one-to-many).

- **Bookings**:
  - **Fields**: `booking_id` (primary key), `user_id` (foreign key to Users), `property_id` (foreign key to Properties), `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`, `total_price`.
  - **Relationships**: Belongs to one user and one property (many-to-one).

- **Payments**:
  - **Fields**: `payment_id` (primary key), `booking_id` (foreign key to Bookings), `amount`, `payment_date`, `status` (e.g., pending, completed).
  - **Relationships**: Linked to one booking (one-to-one).

- **Reviews**:
  - **Fields**: `review_id` (primary key), `user_id` (foreign key to Users), `property_id` (foreign key to Properties), `rating`, `comment`.
  - **Relationships**: Belongs to one user and one property (many-to-one).
